# Peredelano Profile

[Live Demo](https://popelenkow.github.io/peredelano-profile/)

This is a website for collecting profiles of people from the IT industry.

- Extension: We implement an additional web service that expands the original idea [Peredelano Startups](https://t.me/peredelanoconfjunior)
- Profiles: We collect user profiles of people from the IT industry in order to attract them to new projects, new jobs and provide unique offers for their profile.
- Juniors: This project is being developed by juniors and, in addition to the main idea of the project, is a platform for teaching programming.

## Profiles

We are in the process of implementing the functionality. At the moment we have a team and a [developer chat](https://discord.com/channels/1109396222604738612/1111581536123375626) where we discuss tasks and share news. Also join us and take part in [our actual tasks on the board](https://github.com/users/popelenkow/projects/1).
